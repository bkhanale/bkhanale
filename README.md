### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Bhushan. I'm currently working at [Turtlemint](https://turtlemint.com) as a
Software Engineer.
- I usually write a lot of Python, C++ and Java. Although I'm trying to learn a few
more languages, like Go and Rust.
- I'm really interested in Devops.
- Contact me for interesting projects, jobs, etc or if you want to have a competitive
programming contest with me. :D
- Connect with me on my email [hello@bhushankhanale.com](mailto:hello@bhushankhanale.com)
